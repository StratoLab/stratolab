# Overview

The information and steps in these sections can be used to prepare, assemble, and predict the flight behavior of our high altitude balloon project. We cover applicable laws and regulations, materials needed to assemble a balloon, general instructions for assembly, and useful tools for predicting launch telemetry as the launch time approaches.

Most important of all, before getting started, mentors and students should review all relevant laws and regulations.
