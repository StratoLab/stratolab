- Gloves for anyone touching the balloon (Nitrile or cotton if using hydrogen. These protect the latex from oils in handlers skin)
- Stocking caps (these will protect the balloon form oils in hair especially in windy conditions when the balloon bounces off of everything)
- Lift Gas (Choose lift gas thats available, most common since helium shortages is hydrogen)
- Gas regulator (this is specific by gas type)
- [Balloon filler](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-inflator-2/)

- Tether - Tank to balloon (Can be tied from paracord and use a clip for quick detachment)
- Tether - Balloon to safety weight (Can be tied from paracord and use a clip for quick detachment)
- Duct tape (Used for attaching payload items, sealing payload, other misc needs. use a high quality tape like gaffers tape or Gorilla brand etc)
- Electircal tape (Used to cover sharp edges when zip ties are clipped. Also used to seal balloon neck to the filler tube)
- [Heavy Zip ties](https://www.amazon.com/Industrial-250-lbs-Strength-Electrical-Karoka/dp/B099PF1LMM/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=11A1R7BOUWGHK&keywords=heavy%2Bduty%2Bzip%2Bties&qid=1682489919&sprefix=heavy%2Bduty%2Bzip%2Btie%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzRUNQQUJJNUtYQUdSJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDYzMTY2UlZFSUY2V1dONVVQJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAzMzgxMjIyU1NVT1NXSkRHR1FJJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) (Used for sealing the balloon - do not skimp on these, buy 250lb)
- Zip ties light (handy for tasks like attaching antenna wire, payload trinkets etc)
- Wire Flush Cutters (Used to trim zip ties as flush as possible as well as cut antenna wire)
- Adjustable wrench for regulator (Used to attach regualtor to the gas bottle)

## Balloon and payload
- [Ballon](https://www.kaymont.com/product-page/hab-tx-1500) (Consider using the TX balloons for cold conditions)
- [Parachute](https://the-rocketman.com/recovery-html/) (4' is typically sufficient)
- [Shock Cord - Open Loop (2 - 12')](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-y-harness-and-shock-cord/)
- [Payload harness - 4 way open loop ](https://the-rocketman.com/weather-balloon-y-harness-and-shock-cord/)
- Payload boxes (Styrofoam coolers work well)

## Payload contents
- [Light APRS / WSPR tracker](https://qrp-labs.com/lightaprsw2.html) (This allows real time tracking using amateur radio. Note this requires a licensced operator)
- Batteries for tracker (4 AAA work well, consider lithium cells)
- Battery holders for tracker (4 cell holders in serial)
- [Battery pack for cameras and student data loggers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H4GLZXT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (Any can be used jsut be sure to scale for your battery draw needs. These need to be inside the cooler or they will stop working at -10c)
- USB splitter cable (for powering cameras and data loggers)
- Cameras (action cameras similar to GoPro style cameras. Using generic brands will lesson the sting if the payload is lost. We have flown 4k 60fps units running about $140 each)
- Arduino or Raspberry Pi assembly (covered in the Telemetry section of the project)
